we have set welcome file as "/book.do"

DispatcherServlet will check which controller has got a "@GetMapping" method as "book". [this name has to be unique ]

we have "BookController" which is having 

@Controller

public class BookNewController
once DispatcherServlet gets the controller which has  "@GetMapping" method for "book" , it will invoke that method 

	@GetMapping("book")
	public ModelAndView before()
	{
		Book defaultBook=new Book();
return new ModelAndView("bookNew","mybook",defaultBook);
	}

this method 
a) creates instance of "Book"
b) creates ModelAndView which consists of
	(i) "bookNew" name of the jsp to which DispatcherServlet will forward the request.
	(ii) stores instance of Book inside ModelAndView by the name "mybook" so that jsp in which we are going to create a form will use it.( by "modelAttribute")

DispatcherServlet forwards the request to "bookNew.jsp" which creates a form using "modelAttribute" as "mybook".

inside form we have mentioned "path" for textfield so that when submit button will be called , DispatcherServlet" will 
1) instantiate "Book" class and invoke setter methods for the matching "path" names.
2) pass that Book class instance to the controller method which has  "@PostMapping("book")
	
	@PostMapping("book")
	public String afterSubmit(
		@ModelAttribute("mb") Book book) 
	{
		return "success";
	}


this method saves Book class instance given by jsp inside request attribute by the name "mb".
( @ModelAttribute("mb") is same as request.setAttribute("mb",book).

"return success" means DispatcherServlet will forward the request to "success.jsp" which will access "mb".
