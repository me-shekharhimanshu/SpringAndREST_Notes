"Student_Mapper.java" and "StudentDAOImpl.java" have to be in different packages. if they are in same package say e.g. "mypack" then we get following error:


No unique bean of type [mypack.StudentDAO] is defined: expected single matching bean but found 2: [studentDAOImpl, studentDAO]

it is because we have specified 

<bean class="org.mybatis.spring.mapper.MapperScannerConfigurer">
  <property name="basePackage" value="mypack" />
</bean>

here IOC Container will create implementation of all the interfaces available inside "mypack" i.e. Student_Mapper and StudentDAO.
this results into two implementations of StudentDAO , one we have created and other created by IOC Container.
