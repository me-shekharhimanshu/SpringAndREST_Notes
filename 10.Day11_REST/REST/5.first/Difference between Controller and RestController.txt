Controller is the one which returns control to "View" i.e. JSP.
That's why Controller's method can either return "ModelAndView" or "String".  Both ModelAndView and String consist of JSP name.


RestController is the one which returns the response directly to the client.

But then what is the exact meaning of RestController?
ans:-In case of RESTful services, controller is supposed to return the response directly to the client. For this to work on the Controller class we have to apply two annotations i.e.

@Controller
@ResponseBody

now instead of giving these two annotations you can use following annotation:
@RestController

It means @RestController=@ResponseBody+@Controller
