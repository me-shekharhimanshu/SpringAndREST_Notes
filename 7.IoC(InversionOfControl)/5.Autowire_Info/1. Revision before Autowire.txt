IOC
Inversion of Control aka DI  Dependency Injection

classes which would like to work together are known as beans

we need to configure beans and their wiring inside spring bean configuration file. 

wiring means creating association between beans.

IOC container
	instantiates all the configured beans
	injects beans with the specified dependency

There are two types of injections
	setter injection -  property - tag

	constructor injection - constructor-arg    tag

All beans are by default instantiated in "eager" manner. i.e. immediately after application instantiates IOC container 	(ClassPathXmlApplicationContext ). For this to happen , while instantiating IOC container we must pass Spring bean configuration file name.

There are 5 types of bean scopes in spring
singleton  
	only one instance of bean per IOC container
prototype
	creates new instance every time we invoke "getBean"

Following scopes are related to web application:

request
session
global session
